# Confess Your Sins

**"Venite ad me, omnes qui laboratis et onerati estis, et ego reficiam vos."**  
(Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest. – Matthew 11:28)

Greetings, my dear children in Christ! Welcome to *Confession Booth*, a humble digital sanctuary where souls may unburden their sins in anonymity, seeking the mercy of Our Lord through the intercession of His unworthy servant. This webpage, crafted with the simplicity of olden days and the solemnity of Gregorian chants, offers a place for contrition and absolution. *Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa*—here, you may confess, and here, you shall find peace.

## Purpose of This Sacred Endeavor

In these modern times, the faithful may find themselves afar from the confessional screen. *Confession Booth* bridges that gap, offering a virtual booth where sins may be laid bare before God, free from judgment or record. No earthly eye shall see your words, for this is a place of divine grace alone. *Domine, non sum dignus*—yet through this simple tool, His mercy flows.

## Features of the Booth

- **A Retro Sanctuary**: Inspired by the humble screens of yore, this booth recalls the days of Nintendo’s classics—pixelated yet pure, with a priestly figure to guide you.
- **Gregorian Chants**: The sacred strains of MIDI chants fill the air, lifting your soul as you confess. *Veni Creator Spiritus*.
- **Typing Effects**: Each word of guidance appears as if etched by an ancient scribe, accompanied by the clatter of keys from days past.
- **An Animated Priest**: My digital likeness stands ready, offering words of absolution with a gentle sway, a reminder of the Church’s steadfast presence.
- **Anonymity**: No record is kept, no trace remains—your sins are offered to God alone, and His forgiveness washes them away.

## How to Enter the Confession Booth

### Prerequisites
To bring this booth to your flock, you’ll need:
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or the like).
- The files of this sacred repository:
  - `index.html`: The heart of the booth.
  - `styles.css`: The humble vestments of its design.
  - `script.js`: The voice of its guidance.
  - Assets:
    - `chant.mid`: The holy music of the ages.
    - `type.wav`: The sound of contrition’s keys.
    - `priest.png`: My pixelated form.

### Installation
1. **Acquire the Relics**:
   - Download this repository as a ZIP file from GitHub, or clone it with the arcane art of Git:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/confession-booth.git
     ```
   - Place all files in a single folder, as the saints gathered in unity.

2. **Test the Sanctity**:
   - Open `index.html` in your browser. Behold the booth in its glory—ensure the chants play, the priest moves, and the words of forgiveness flow.

3. **Share with the Faithful**:
   - To make this booth a beacon for all, host it on GitHub Pages:
     - Upload all files to a GitHub repository named `confession-booth`.
     - In the repository’s **Settings**, under **GitHub Pages**, set the source to the `main` branch and root directory.
     - Await the divine URL (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/confession-booth`), and share it with your flock.

## Usage

1. **Approach the Booth**:
   - Visit the webpage in your browser. The chants will greet you, and my pixelated form will stand ready.

2. **Confess Your Sins**:
   - Type your burdens into the text box provided. Fear not, for no earthly hand shall record them.

3. **Receive Absolution**:
   - Press the “Confess” button, and I shall offer words of penance and forgiveness, drawn from the well of Catholic tradition. *Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis*.

4. **Go in Peace**:
   - Once absolved, depart with a heart renewed. *Pax vobis*.

## Technical Notes for the Sacristan

- **File Formats**: Ensure your MIDI file is a `.mid` (not `.rmi`). If it bears the mark of `.rmi`, convert it thus:
  - Use FFmpeg: `ffmpeg -i chant.rmi chant.mid`.
  - Or an online tool such as Convertio.
- **Browser Quirks**: Some browsers may silence the chants until you click to allow sound. This is their penance for modernity.
- **Assets**: Place `chant.mid`, `type.wav`, and `priest.png` in the same folder as `index.html`, lest the booth fall silent or blind.

## A Word of Caution

This is no substitute for the Sacrament of Reconciliation, my children. The true confessional, with a priest ordained in the line of Melchizedek, offers grace beyond what pixels can bestow. *Confession Booth* is but a tool for reflection and peace in times of need—use it as such, and seek the Church when you can.

## Acknowledgments

- To the makers of GitHub Pages, who provide this digital pulpit.
- To the faithful who crafted the chants and sounds of old, preserved for our use.
- Above all, to Our Lord, *Domine Deus Sabaoth*, whose mercy inspires this work.

## Final Blessing

May this *Confession Booth* bring solace to the weary and light to the shadowed soul. *In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, Amen.*

Go forth, my children, and sin no more. Should you wish to improve this booth, fork this repository and offer your gifts. *Deus vobiscum*.
